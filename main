## **Project Description**

This project focuses on:
1. Cleaning a dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent formatting.
2. Visualizing the cleaned data to uncover trends and patterns.
3. Saving the cleaned dataset for future use.

     - Sets missing joining dates to `"2025-01-04"`.
   - **Date Formatting**: Converts joining dates to a standard datetime format.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Country Distribution**: Bar chart showing the number of employees by country.
   - **Age Distribution**: Histogram displaying the age distribution of employees.
   - **Salary Distribution**: Histogram showcasing the salary distribution of employees.

3. **Export Cleaned Data**:
   - Saves the cleaned dataset as a CSV file (`clean_data.csv`).
